## 🔧 Firebase Synchronization Fixes
**Date:** Current Update  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Overview
Fixed critical synchronization issues to ensure all team data syncs properly across browsers and devices.

### ✅ Issues Fixed:

#### 1. Spinner Values Synchronization
- **Problem:** Host spinner selections (standup & retro) were stored locally and didn't sync across browsers
- **Solution:** Moved spinner values to Firebase `appSettings` collection
- **Result:** Selected hosts now sync in real-time across all team members' browsers

#### 2. Persistent Loading Indicator
- **Problem:** "Loading tickets..." message persisted even when tickets were loaded on retro board
- **Solution:** Updated loading condition to check both loading state and ticket count
- **Result:** Loading indicator now disappears properly when data is loaded

#### 3. Firestore Document Path Structure
- **Problem:** Invalid document references with odd number of segments
- **Solution:** Restructured to use proper collection/document/collection/document pattern
- **Result:** All Firebase operations now work correctly

### 🔄 Updated Data Structure:
```
teams/{teamId}/
├── members/           # Team member profiles

│   └── current        # Current retro configuration
└── appSettings/       # Application-wide settings
    └── current        # Current app state (spinner values, etc.)
```

### 🚀 Real-time Sync Features:
- **Host selections** sync instantly across all browsers
- **Retro board tickets** appear in real-time for all participants
- **Voting results** update live as team members vote
